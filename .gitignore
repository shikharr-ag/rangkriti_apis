# If you use a requirements file (which you SHOULD)
# You generally don't need to ignore the contents of your virtual environment
# But if you have very large packages you could consider ignoring their subdirectories.

# If you have large media files or datasets, you might want to exclude them.
# Consider using a separate storage solution for these.

# If you have specific build artifacts, you can ignore them like so:
*.tar.gz
*.zip
